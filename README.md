## GENCODE WITH DATABASE \ PYTHON
We have created a Python code generator that sends the code directly to the database. Currently it was made for a FIVEM server that uses a Redeem system




## Version 
We are currently using the discord version NEXTCORD, but you can rewrite the code to Discord but we can't guarantee anything because we didn't write it in the discord version


## Slash Commands:
We wrote everything in slash commands so it's easy to execute


## Need to Install
```shell
pip install nextcord
```

```shell
pip install pytz
```

```shell
pip install mysql-connector
```
